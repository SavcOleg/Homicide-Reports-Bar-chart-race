About data.
The Murder Accountability Project is the most complete database of homicides in the United States currently available. 
This dataset includes murders from the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Report from 1976 
to the present and Freedom of Information Act data on more than 22,000 homicides that were not reported to the Justice Department. 
This dataset includes the age, race, sex, ethnicity of victims and perpetrators, 
in addition to the relationship between the victim and perpetrator and weapon used.
